# HM64 Autobuilder
This is a simple repository to automatically obtain new release tags (once per day) and if newer than our release tags, build a new release. The releases contain linux aarch64 binaries and required files for the following:

- Ship of Harkinian (used with [PortMaster's Ship of Harkinian port](https://github.com/JeodC/PortMaster-ShipOfHarkinian))
- 2 Ship 2 Harkinian (used with [PortMaster's 2Ship2Harkinian port](https://github.com/JeodC/PortMaster-2Ship2Harkinian))
- Starship (used with [PortMaster's Starship port](https://github.com/JeodC/PortMaster-Starship))
